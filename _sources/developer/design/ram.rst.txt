Designing RAM Class
###################

As stated in :ref:`parallel_runtime_design` we need abstractions to represent
the physical hardware resources on the computer. The ``RAM`` class models
the random-access memory of a node.

*****************************
Why Do We Need the RAM Class?
*****************************

From the perspective of ParallelZone, the ``RAM`` class is primarily envisioned
as a means for users to specify the start/end points of one-to-all and
all-to-one MPI operations. End users can also use the ``RAM`` class to
figure out how much memory the process has access to, which can be useful for
selecting among algorithms (space-time trade-off).

*********************
Design Considerations
*********************

Including the considerations brought up in :ref:`parallel_runtime_design` and
:ref:`resource_set_design` we see the ``RAM`` class needing to consider:

1. Current "state"

   - Total capacity
   - Total free memory
   - Total used memory
   - Potentially the transfer rate

#. All-to-one and one-to-all MPI operations
#. Encapsulation of details
#. Automatic tracking of memory usage

*****************************
Architecture of the RAM Class
*****************************

.. _fig_ram:

.. figure:: assets/ram.png
   :align: center

   High-level architecture of the RAM class.

:numref:`fig_ram` illustrates the main pieces of the ``RAM`` class. These
pieces address the concerns by:

1. We use the PAPI runtime system for accessing information about the ``RAM``
#. A ``CommPP`` object is used for the MPI operations.
#. The use of the PIMPL idiom allows us to avoid leaking PAPI or the ``CommPP``
   object through the API.
#. This issue has not been resolved, but could be done through a custom
   allocator class tied to the ``RAM`` object.

*************
Proposed APIs
*************

Examples of all-to-one communication with ParallelZone.

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto rt = get_runtime();

   // Each resource set generates some data
   auto data = generate_data();

   // This gathers the data from all members of rt to resource set 0
   // Type U is deducible from type of data w/ template meta-programming
   std::optional<U> output = rt.at(0).ram().gather(data);

   if(output.has_value()){
       // This only gets run on rank 0
       // Do stuff with output
   }

   // Reductions are similar, but take an op to apply
   auto op = get_op_to_apply();

   // Similar to gather, this reduces the data down to rank 0's RAM
   // Type V is deducible from type of op w/ template meta-programming
   std::optional<V> output2 = rt.at(0).ram().reduce(data, op);

   if(output2.has_value()){
       // This only gets run on rank 0
       // Do stuff with output2
   }

Examples of one-to-all communications

.. code-block:: c++

   auto rt = get_runtime();

   auto data;
   if(me == rt.at(0)){
       data = fill_in_data();
   }

   // Value of data is ignored for ranks not equal to 0
   auto output = rt.at(0).ram().scatter(data);


Examples of one-to-one communications

.. code-block:: c++

   auto rt = get_runtime();

   std::optional<decltype(fill_in_data())> data;
   if(me == rt.at(0)){
       data.emplace(fill_in_data());
   }

   // Sends the data to rank 1, type U determined by template meta-programming
   std::optional<U> output = rt.at(1).ram().send(data);

   if(output.has_value()){
       // This part is only run by rank 1
       // Do stuff with output
   }

The proposed APIs admittedly have some MIMD aspects to them in the
"if I'm root" logic. This could be hidden in a scheduler. Something like:

.. code-block:: c++

   auto future_2_data = rt.schedule([](){return fill_in_data();});

With the idea being the underlying scheduler chooses the root.

****************
Additional Notes
****************

The RAM class is presently a stub. In particular PAPI is not hooked up.
