The RAM Class
#############

As the name suggests, the ``RAM`` class provides an abstraction for the RAM a
process can access.

***********
Getting RAM
***********

``RuntimeView`` objects are containers of ``ResourceSet`` objects, which in
turn are containers of hardware including ``RAM``. Assuming we have a
``RuntimeView`` object ``rv`` we can get a ``RAM`` object by:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tests/cxx/doc_snippets/ram.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 29-33

The first call to ``ResourceSet::ram()`` retrieves a handle to the RAM which
is local to rank 0. The second call gets the ``RAM`` instance local to the
current process (which for rank 0 is the same as ``rank_0_ram``). Once you
have the ``RAM`` object you can see basic stats such as how much total memory
it has by using member functions, for example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tests/cxx/doc_snippets/ram.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 35-37

*************************
All-to-One MPI Operations
*************************

MPI operations are typically categorized based on how many processes are sending
and how many are receiving. In "all-to-one" MPI operations every process
computes some data and sends it to a "root" process. For simplicity, this
tutorial will have process :math:`p` "compute" three integers: :math:`p`,
:math:`p+1`, and :math:`p+2`. If we want to collect all of these computed
results into rank 0's RAM we would do:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tests/cxx/doc_snippets/ram.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 39-43

The resulting object ``all_data`` is a ``std::optional`` which has a value if
``rank_0_ram`` is local to the current process. We can exploit whether or not
``all_data`` has a value to avoid needing to remember which process was the
root for the gather operation. For example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../tests/cxx/doc_snippets/ram.cpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 45-49
