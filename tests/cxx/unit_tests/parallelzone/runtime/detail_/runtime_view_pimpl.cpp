/* Testing Notes
 *
 * Unfortunately fully testing the ctor/dtor is tricky because we can't restart
 * MADNESS/MPI. In particular this means if we make a
 * RuntimeViewPIMPL instance and tell it that it started MADNESS, when it goes
 * out of scope it will finalize MADNESS and break all of the other tests in
 * ParallelZone (unless it just so happens that this is the only test run or
 * the last one).
