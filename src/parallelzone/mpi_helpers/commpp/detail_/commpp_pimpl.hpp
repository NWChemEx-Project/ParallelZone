    /** @brief Binary-based gather call which creates a buffer for the result.
     *
     *  Assume that this communicator has `N` processes and that each process
     *  has a block of binary data that is `b` bytes long. For this call, the
     *  length of the binary data block must be `b` bytes on each process, but
     *  the values in the block can be (and typically are) different. To use
     *  this method, each process provides its local block of binary data and
     *  this method will create a single N * b element binary buffer such that
     *  elements `r * b` through `(r + 1) * b` are the `b` bytes from rank `r`.
     *  If @p root is set, then the output is only local to process @p root,
     *  otherwise each rank of the communicator will have a local copy of the
     *  output.
     *
     *  This is a zero-copy call; however, unless the output data can be
     *  directly used in binary format, it will be necessary to copy out of the
     *  resulting binary buffer to use the results. In some cases, such as when
     *  the object being sent can be interpreted as a contiguous binary buffer,
     *  it will be more efficient to use the other overload of gather, which
     *  allows you to directly gather the result into the target object. See
     *  the documentation for more details.
     *
     *  If @p root is set this method wraps a call to MPI_Gather, if @p root is
     *  not set then this call is analogous to MPI_Allgather. If you can not
     *  guarantee that each process is going to send the same number of bytes
     *  consider using `gatherv`.
     *
     *  @param[in] data The local bytes to send. All processes must send the
     *                  same number of bytes.
     *
     *  @param[in] root The zero-based rank of the process which will get the
     *                  data. If @p root is set this operation will wrap a call
     *                  to MPI_Gather, otherwise (the default scenario), the
     *                  call will be to MPI_Allgather.
     *
     *  @return A std::optional. If @p root is not set, then the std::optional
     *          will contain the gathered bytes on each rank of this
     *          communicator. If @p root is set then the resulting
     *          std::optional will only contain the bytes on the process with
     *          rank @p root.
