ParallelZone Architecture
#########################

:ref:`parallel_zone_design` describes the top-level design decisions which went
into establishing ParallelZone's scope. Here we lay out the architecture of
ParallelZone. The overall architecture is shown in
Figure: :numref:`architecture`.

.. _architecture:

.. figure:: ../../assets/architecture.png
   :align: center

   Software architecture of ParallelZone.

The outer box labeled "ParallelZone" delimits the contents of the ParallelZone
library from its dependencies. The box labeled "RuntimeView" delimits the
user-centric :ref:`api` from the implementation details.

.. note::

   At the moment ParallelZone has no schedulers. The "Schedulers" box is thus
   presently a placeholder.

Notable design points:

- Exposure of a task-based parallel runtime via "Schedulers" component.
- :ref:`mpi` under the hood ensures backwards compatibility.
- Hardware introspection via "Hardware" component.

The following sections describe the ParallelZone components in more detail. The
sections are ordered such that they work their way up the software stack.

************
Dependencies
************

ParallelZone presently has two major dependencies: MADNESS and Cereal.

MADNESS
=======

MADNESS is at the moment a dependency primarily because Tiled Array uses it.
ParallelZone doesn't actually leverage any of the MADNESS features.

.. todo::

   The decision to put MADNESS under ParallelZone, as opposed to straight MPI,
   should be revisited. If no MADNESS features will be used in ParallelZone it
   should be dropped.

Cereal
======

See :ref:`serialization_design` for decisions underpinning the usage of Cereal.
Long story short, we need serialization and Cereal is a lightweight library
implementing it.

***********
MPI Helpers
***********

Main discussion :ref:`mpi_api_design`.

The MPI standard exposes C APIs. "Proper" C++ MPI bindings should automate
much of the call to the C API. More specifically, by using template
meta-programming it is possible to perform type introspection and automatically
determine things like: what the object's type is, and how many are being
sent/received. The MPI Helpers component implements "proper" C++ MPI bindings,
which are then used by the rest of ParallelZone.

**********
Schedulers
**********

.. todo::

   Write this section when more design has gone into the Schedulers.


*************
Serialization
*************

.. todo::

   Design the user-facing serialization API.

The Serialization component is primarily meant to support the "RuntimeView"
component, but given its utility to downstream repositories, the serialization
component is formally exposed as part of the user-centric API.

***********
RuntimeView
***********

Main page: :ref:`parallel_runtime_design`.

The "RuntimeView" component is the top-level API of ParallelZone. The name
"RuntimeView" is chosen to illustrate that it doesn't own the resources in the
runtime environment, but simply aliases them (the resources in the runtime
environment are mostly owned by the operating system).
