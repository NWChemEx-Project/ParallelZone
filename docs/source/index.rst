ParallelZone
############

ParallelZone is a high-level, object-oriented C++ runtime system designed to
facilitate writing high-performance, object-oriented C++ software. ParallelZone
is conceived as being a stable :ref:`API` more than an implementation of a full
blown runtime system. By this we mean that under the hood ParallelZone simply
dispatches to more established runtime systems (such as :ref:`MPI`) and lets
them do the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, the space of runtime systems is highly
turbulent at the moment, which is why we designed ParallelZone to provide a
buffer that insulates downstream dependencies from the chaotic underpinnings.

The main features of ParallelZone include:

- Object-oriented API. C++ is object-oriented. Your runtime should be too.
- :ref:`SIMD`-like API. ParallelZone's API is designed to help you write
  parallel code that looks serial because that's the easiest kind to write.
- Support for process parallelism.
- Backwards compatible with MPI.

Planned features:

- Thread support
- Better hardware detection/introspection
- Asynchronous execution
- Hardware aware scheduling
