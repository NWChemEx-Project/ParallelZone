/** @brief Provides a runtime API for interacting with memory
 *
 *  The RAM class is envisoned as being the primary vessel for tracking memory
 *  usage, and for facilitating getting/setting data from/to remote RAM objects
 *  (i.e., RAM-based one-to-one-, one-to-all, and all-to-one MPI calls).
 *
 *  With regards to tracking memory, Version 1.0 of the RAM class is only
 *  capable of telling the user how much RAM the current process has direct
 *  access to. Better memory tracking requires writing allocators which update
 *  the RAM instance when memory is freed (and having the downstream classes
 *  use the allocators).
 *
 *  TODO: MPI operations need to be templated and use template meta-programming
 *        to deduce return types. For now we just set all types to double and
 *        return std::optional<double>. The present implementations all throw
 *        std::runtime_error("NYI").
