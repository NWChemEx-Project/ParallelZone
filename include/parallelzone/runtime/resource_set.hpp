/** @brief A set of runtime resources.
 *
 *  We assume that when the program is started it has a finite amount of
 *  resources (CPUs, GPUs, memory, etc.) available to it. Furthermore, we
 *  assume that those resources are somehow partitioned into sets (in most, if
 *  not all, cases this is done by a job scheduler). The ResourceSet class
 *  is a runtime abstraction for interacting with one of these sets of
 *  resources.
 *
 *
 *  In MPI terms, a ResourceSet maps to an MPI rank.
 *  There may be some resources that every Worker can see (think a
 *  parallel filesystem), but in general each Worker can only see a subset of
 *  the resources in the ResourceSet (the ResourceSet class internally knows
 *  this mapping).
