/** @brief A view of the execution environment.
 *
 *  The runtime (environment) is where a program runs. The RuntimeView class
 *  provides an API for querying properties of the runtime. The "view" part of
 *  the name signifies that a RuntimeView instance does not own the state, but
 *  only aliases it.
 *
 *  Users should be aware that a RuntimeView instance may only be a slice of the
 *  actual runtime (either because other programs are running on the computer
 *  or because another part of the program is using resources).
 *
 *  In MPI terms think of RuntimeView as an intra-communicator paralleling
 *  MPI_COMM_WORLD; however, the underlying MPI_Comm need not be MPI_COMM_WORLD.
 *
 *  @note RuntimeView uses RAII (resource acquisition is initialization) to
 *        manage MADNESS/MPI. This means that if you do supply a handle to an
 *        already initialized MADNESS/MPI runtime, then RuntimeView will assume
 *        it is using MPI_COMM_WORLD and will initialize MADNESS/MPI if
 *        necesary. In the event that RuntimeView does initialize MADNESS/MPI,
 *        it is also responsible for tearing-down MADNESS/MPI when the last
 *        reference to MADNESS/MPI goes out of scope. Internally, this is
 *        managed with a shared_ptr. So if you want to ensure that MADNESS/MPI
 *        is not finalized while you're doing something, make sure you hold on
 *        to a RuntimeView.
